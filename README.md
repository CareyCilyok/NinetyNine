# NinetyNine
Scorekeeper for the pool game of Ninety-Nine

## Background
The game of Ninety-Nine (or simply '99') was created by [Pool & Billiard Magazine](http://poolmag.com). 
The original rules can be found [here](http://poolmag.com/game-rules/). The modified rules for
this version are below.

## Rules
### Object of the Game:
'99' is played with nine object balls numbered one through nine, and a cue ball.
Play is divided into Nine Innings (Racks) for each player, with a maximum Rack
Score of 11 (Eleven) Points, and thus a maximum Game Score of 99 Points.
On each shot AFTER the break, the first ball contacted by the
cue ball must be the lowest numbered ball on the table.
When this requirement is met on a legal shot, any ball pocketed as a result
is scored and allows the player to continue their inning. A player’s inning will
end when they miss pocketing a legal ball, commit a foul, or complete the
inning by legally scoring the nine ball, or pocketing all the balls on the table.
The incoming player then begins their inning with a new Rack and play rotates
after each inning ends. If the player is playing alone, they re-rack the balls and
begin the next inning and continue in the same manner for each inning.

### Racking the Balls:
The object balls are racked in a diamond shape. In each inning the balls are
racked with the nine ball in the center and the “inning ball” at the top of the
diamond on the foot spot. The “inning ball” racked at the top of the diamond
corresponds to the Rack that is being played. Thus, in the first Rack (inning),
the one ball is the top ball, and in the second Rack the two ball is the first ball,
and so on. In the ninth Rack, when the nine ball must become the top ball,
the one ball is placed in the center of the rack. In each inning, except for the
nineball and the inning ball, all the other balls are racked in random order.### Beginning Play:
Players begin each inning with the cue ball “in- hand” behind the head
string. A player is not required to contact the lowest numbered ball first during
the break, because the first, or top, ball is not always the lowest ball.
After the break, no matter what the outcome, the player begins with ball in hand anywhere on the table, and continues until he or she fails to legally pocket
a ball, pockets all the balls, or legally pockets the nine ball at any point.
Balls pocketed on the break and all legally pocketed balls after the break,
count as one point each toward the player’s “Ball Count” points (see Scoring).
Scratching on the break does NOT end the player’s inning, and balls made on
a “Scratch Break” are treated just as if the player did not scratch. They stay off
the table and ARE counted in the player’s “Ball Count” score for the inning.
However, if the nine ball is made on a break in which the player scratches, it is only
counted as one point, remains off the table and the player continues the inning.
A nine ball made on a legal break is counted as 9 “Ball Count” points.### Scoring:
Ball Count – The total number of object balls pocketed both during and legally
after the break during an inning. A maximum of 9 “Ball Count” points are
available in each inning.
Break Bonus – If the player legally pockets one or more balls on the break,
they are awarded 2 “Break Bonus” points.
Scratch on the Break – Balls pocketed during a scratch on the break are counted
toward a players “Ball Count” for the inning, however the Break Bonus is not
awarded because of the scratch. A maximum of 11 points can be awarded
in each inning (2 “Break Bonus” points plus 9 “Ball Count” points).### Fouls:
Balls pocketed on a Scratch (except on the break), foul or other illegal
shot DO NOT count toward a player’s score and end the inning.
Touching an object ball is not a foul (cue ball fouls only), but a disturbed
object ball must be replaced as close as possible to its original position.
Driving an object ball off the table on any shot (except on the break) is a foul and
ends the player’s inning. An un-pocketed object ball is considered to be driven off
the table if it comes to rest anywhere other than the playing surface.
