# NinetyNine
Scorekeeper for the pool game of Ninety-Nine

## Background
The game of Ninety-Nine (or simply '99') was created by [Pool & Billiard Magazine](http://poolmag.com). 
The original rules can be found [here](http://poolmag.com/game-rules/). The modified rules for
this version are below.

## Rules
### Object of the Game:
'99' is played with nine object balls numbered one through nine, and a cue ball.
For those familiar with 'playing the Ghost', '99' is like playing the 9-ball Ghost
but a partial score is awarded for breaking well and pocketing balls.

Play is divided into Nine Frames (racks) for each player, with a maximum Frame
Score of 11 (Eleven) Points, and thus a maximum Game Score of 99 Points.
On each shot after the break, the first ball contacted by the
cue ball must be the lowest numbered ball on the table.
When this requirement is met on a legal shot, any ball pocketed as a result
is scored and allows the player to continue their frame. A player’s frame will
end when they miss pocketing a legal ball, commit a foul, or complete the
frame by legally pocketing the last ball.
The incoming player then begins their frame with a new rack and play rotates
after each frame ends. If the player is playing alone, they re-rack the balls and
begin the next frame and continue in the same manner for each frame.

### Racking the Balls:
The object balls are racked in a normal 9-ball diamond shape. With the 1-ball on 
the foot spot, the 9-ball in the center and the remaing balls racked randomly.

### Begframe Play:
Players begin each frame with the cue ball “in hand” behind the head
string. After the break, no matter what the outcome, the player begins with ball in 
hand anywhere on the table, and continues until the player fails to legally pocket
a ball or pockets all the balls.
Balls pocketed on the break and all legally pocketed balls after the break,
count as one point each toward the player’s “Ball Count” points (see Scoring).
Scratching on the break does NOT end the player’s frame, and balls made on
a “Scratch Break” are treated just as if the player did not scratch. They stay off
the table and are counted in the player’s “Ball Count” score for the frame.
However, if the nine ball is made on a break in which the player scratches, remains 
off the table and the player continues the frame. A nine ball made on a any break
is counted as 2 “Ball Count” points.

### Scoring:
Ball Count – The total number of object balls pocketed both during and legally
after the break during an frame. A maximum of 10 “Ball Count” points are
available in each frame. The 9-ball has a value of 2 "Ball Count" points and
each of the other balls has a value of 1 "Ball Count" point.

Pocketing the 9-ball - Pocketing the 9-ball on the break shot or as a combination
during the frame does not end the frame. The 9-Ball is counted as 2 "Ball Count"
points and the player continues until a missed shot or pocketing the remaing balls.

Break Bonus – If the player legally pockets one or more balls on the break,
they are awarded 1 “Break Bonus” point.

Scratch on the Break – Balls pocketed during a scratch on the break are counted
toward a players “Ball Count” for the frame, however the Break Bonus is not
awarded because of the scratch. A maximum of 11 points can be awarded
in each frame (1 “Break Bonus” point plus 10 “Ball Count” points).

### Fouls:
Balls pocketed on a Scratch (except on the break), foul or other illegal
shot DO NOT count toward a player’s score and end the frame.
Touching an object ball is not a foul (cue ball fouls only), but a disturbed
object ball must be replaced as close as possible to its original position.
Driving an object ball off the table on any shot (except on the break) is a foul and
ends the player’s frame. An un-pocketed object ball is considered to be driven off
the table if it comes to rest anywhere other than the playing surface. Un-pocketed balls
occuring on the break shot will be spotted.
